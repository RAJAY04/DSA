    //Imagine this problem like, There is a gathering organized by some guy, the guest list is [1,2,3,1,1,3].
    //The problem with the guest is they only handshake with like minded people. (Like minded here is basically the digit should be same , for example, 1 will handshake with 1 only, 2 will handshake with 2 only and so on)
    //
    //So, finally we just need to count number of handshakes in the gathering. ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯
    //
    //(To distinguish , multiple 1's and 3's , a,b,c,d... letters are used)
    //
    //ðŸ”¥ the day of arrival ðŸ”¥
    //
    //one by one guests are arriving at the gathering
    //
    //âœ… first guest: 1
    //
    //âœ… second guest: 2
    //(at this moment, in gathering hall we have 1 (2 is about to enter) , since they are not like minded they wont shake hands)
    //
    //âœ… third guest:3
    //(at this moment, in gathering hall we have 1 ,2 (3 is about to enter), since they are not like minded they wont shake hands)
    //
    //âœ… fourth guest : 1
    //(at this moment, fourth guest will see in gathering hall , there is one like minded guy ie(1) , so he will handshake with him)
    //therefore totalHandShake = 1
    //
    //âœ… fifth guest : 1
    //(at this moment, fifth guest will see in gathering hall, there are two like minded guys ie(1,1) , so he will handshake with them)
    //therefore totalHandShake = 1(last handshake between 1a-1b ) + 2(current handshake between 1a-1c, 1b-1c) = 3
    //
    //âœ… sixth guest : 3
    //(at this moment, sixth guest will see in gathering hall, there is one like minded guy ie(3) , so he will handshake with him)
    //therefore totalHandShake = 3(last handshake) + 1(3a-3b) = 4

    //given array as guest list.
    //Hashmap as gathering hall
